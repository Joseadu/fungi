                        <p>You'll need a local field guide, a sharp knife or scissors, a basket or mesh bag for
                            collecting, and
                            paper bags for separating specimens. Bring a small brush for cleaning, wear sturdy boots,
                            and carry
                            a GPS device or compass to track your location. A camera is also helpful to document your
                            finds.</p>

                            <p>Learn from experienced foragers and reliable guidebooks – never rely on apps alone. Study
                                each
                                mushroom's specific features like cap shape, gill structure, stem characteristics, and
                                spore prints.
                                Start with easily identifiable species that have no poisonous lookalikes, and never eat
                                anything
                                unless you're completely certain of its identification.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Where can I find foraging spots?</h3>
                            <p>Look in deciduous forests, especially near oak and maple trees, and in damp, shaded
                                areas. Fallen
                                logs and dead trees are often productive spots. Only forage on public lands where it's
                                allowed, and
                                always check local regulations. Remember to get permission for private property and keep
                                your best
                                locations private to prevent over-harvesting.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title">What are the best seasons for mushroom foraging?</h3>
                        <p>Spring is ideal for morels, late summer brings chanterelles and boletes, and fall is peak
                            season for
                            most mushrooms including oysters and hen of the woods. Some species can even be found in
                            winter,
                            especially in milder climates. Each season offers different varieties, so year-round
                            foraging is
                            possible.</p>
